## Analysis Framework

When designing state synchronization, systematically evaluate:

1. **State Boundaries**: What state belongs on client vs server?
2. **Consistency Requirements**: Strong vs eventual consistency needs?
3. **Real-Time Needs**: What data needs real-time updates?
4. **Offline Requirements**: What functionality works offline?
5. **Conflict Scenarios**: How to handle concurrent modifications?
6. **Performance Constraints**: What are the latency and bandwidth limits?
7. **Scalability Needs**: How many concurrent users are expected?

## Output Requirements

- SSE for updates, WebSocket for bidirectional communication
- Polling fallback for unreliable connections
- Push notifications for background updates

## Offline-First Strategies

- Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)
- Vector clocks for version tracking
- Merkle trees for efficient sync

### **Sync Strategies**

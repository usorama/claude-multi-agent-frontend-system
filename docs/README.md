3. **`/backend`** - Backend development with 6 specialized agents
4. **`/fullstack`** - Full-stack coordination with 6 integration agents
5. **`/cicd`** - DevOps and infrastructure with 6 automation agents

### Agent Coordination Model

Each command follows a proven 6-agent architecture:

```
Phase 1: Knowledge Gathering (Parallel)
├── Agent 1: Domain Analysis
├── Agent 2: Technical Research

### 1. Natural Language Processing

When you invoke a command, the system:

1. **Parses** your natural language request
2. **Analyzes** keywords and context indicators
3. **Classifies** the workflow type and complexity
4. **Configures** agents with appropriate capabilities

### 2. Agent Coordination

The Master Orchestrator:

1. **Spawns** specialized agents using Claude Code's Task tool
2. **Coordinates** parallel execution for efficiency
3. **Synthesizes** results from all agents
4. **Creates** comprehensive implementation plans

### 3. Knowledge Integration

Each agent:

1. **Analyzes** their specific domain thoroughly
2. **Researches** best practices and current solutions
3. **Documents** findings and recommendations
4. **Contributes** to the overall implementation strategy

### 4. Implementation & Validation

The implementation process:

1. **Executes** according to the comprehensive plan
2. **Validates** against established patterns and standards
3. **Tests** functionality and performance
4. **Documents** decisions and implementations

### 5. Institutional Learning

The system continuously:

1. **Builds** knowledge base from each project
2. **Improves** pattern recognition and recommendations
3. **Adapts** to new technologies and best practices
4. **Maintains** consistency across projects

## Best Practices

### 🎯 Clear Communication

**Be Specific**:
```bash
# Good
/ui "create responsive navigation with hamburger menu for mobile, dropdown for desktop, using our design system colors"

# Avoid
/ui "make navigation better"
```

**Provide Context**:
```bash
# Good
/backend "design user authentication API for React app with JWT tokens, supporting email/password and Google OAuth"

# Avoid
/backend "add auth"
```

### 🏗️ Incremental Development

**Start Simple**:
```bash
# Phase 1
/backend "create basic user registration and login API"

# Phase 2
/fullstack "integrate user authentication with React frontend"

# Phase 3
/cicd "setup deployment pipeline for user management system"
```

### 🔄 Iterative Improvement

**Use Feedback Loops**:
1. Start with basic implementation
2. Test and gather feedback
3. Use `/so` for comprehensive improvements
4. Validate with stakeholders

### 📚 Leverage Knowledge Building

**Build on Previous Work**:
- Reference previous implementations
- Mention existing patterns and decisions
- Use consistent terminology across projects
- Document architectural decisions

### 🔍 Validation and Testing

**Always Include Testing**:
```bash
/fullstack "build user dashboard with comprehensive testing strategy"
/cicd "setup deployment pipeline with automated testing and validation"
```

## Dos and Don'ts

### ✅ DO

**Provide Clear Requirements**:
- Specify target platforms and browsers
- Include performance requirements
- Mention security considerations
- Define scalability needs

**Use Appropriate Commands**:
- Use `/ui` for frontend-only tasks
- Use `/backend` for API and server tasks
- Use `/fullstack` for end-to-end features
- Use `/cicd` for infrastructure and deployment
- Use `/so` for complex cross-domain tasks

**Iterate and Refine**:
- Start with basic requirements
- Gather feedback and iterate
- Use the system's learning capabilities
- Build complexity gradually

**Leverage Cross-Domain Capabilities**:
- Use `/so` for complex multi-domain tasks
- Coordinate frontend and backend development
- Integrate deployment and monitoring early

### ❌ DON'T

**Avoid Vague Requests**:
```bash
# Don't
/ui "make it look good"
/backend "make it faster"
/cicd "fix deployment"
```

**Don't Skip Context**:
- Don't assume the system knows your specific requirements
- Don't omit important constraints or limitations
- Don't skip architectural context

**Don't Ignore Security**:
- Don't implement authentication without security considerations
- Don't skip input validation and sanitization
- Don't ignore compliance requirements

**Don't Over-Engineer**:
- Don't request complex solutions for simple problems
- Don't implement features before they're needed
- Don't optimize prematurely without measurements

**Don't Mix Unrelated Concerns**:
```bash
# Don't
/ui "create dashboard and setup database and deploy to production"

# Do
/so "create complete dashboard system with database and deployment"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Agent Coordination Timeouts**
- **Symptom**: Agents take too long to respond
- **Cause**: Complex requirements or network issues
- **Solution**: Break down into smaller, focused tasks

**2. Inconsistent Recommendations**
- **Symptom**: Agents provide conflicting advice
- **Cause**: Ambiguous requirements or missing context
- **Solution**: Provide more specific requirements and constraints

**3. Implementation Gaps**
- **Symptom**: Generated code doesn't work as expected
- **Cause**: Missing dependencies or configuration
- **Solution**: Use `/fullstack` for complete integration or provide more context

**4. Performance Issues**
- **Symptom**: Generated solutions don't meet performance requirements
- **Cause**: Requirements not specified or unrealistic expectations
- **Solution**: Specify performance requirements upfront

### Debugging Strategies

**1. Start Simple**:
Begin with basic implementations and add complexity gradually

**2. Use Specific Commands**:
Use domain-specific commands (`/ui`, `/backend`) for focused tasks

**3. Provide Examples**:
Include examples of what you want or reference existing implementations

**4. Validate Incrementally**:
Test each component before moving to integration
